Frage is an Open Search Engine

## Project Goals

I have an odd belief I hope to convince you of. I think search engines are the most important technology mankind has created. Our ancestors were so data starved that they groveled at the feet of idols for a nugget of wisdom about coming rain. The future of battles was sussed out by staring at animal entrails. Today the problem is inverted, mankind creates more data each year than has existed for the previous eternity. Like the proverbial ark the search engine has emerged to keep us from drowning in our data.  

Unfortunately search engines rather than being a venture all of humanity is involved in the problem is driven by a tiny few. What should be an open and often talked about research problem is mostly considered in the exclusive halls of academia, and the very closed doors of the tech giants.

The major goal of frage is simple. 

**Provide a truly open search engine technology.**

The hope is that more people will become well informed about how searches work, and the political and social implications of these system. The pipe dream is that enough people will be invested in the idea of a truly open search engine to support the creation of a technology capable of displacing the proprietary giants.

If you are looking for a full text search techonology to use in your app there are existing technologies out of the box that are almost certainly a better fit, see https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch. If you are looking for a more bespoke search solution feel free to hit me up.
